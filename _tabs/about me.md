## Brief Introduction

Welcome! My name is [Aaromal](https://github.com/aaromal03), and I am a Mechanical Engineer, with primary interest in Automobiles. I am the Chief Designer of Mechismu Racing-Electric, Formula student team from India. I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. I'll be sharing my projects, insights and knowledge as I pursue my passion of developing vehicles, machines and robots.

My primary areas of expertise include:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Design, manufacture and optimize machines of all kinds.
- **Vehicle Development**: Drafting Dreams on wheels to move souls. From bending air to strengthening strucutres and everything in between. 
- **Design Solutions**: Developing products and machines for industrial problems.

I believe that vehicles and machines are more than some parts made to accomplish some task. They are the dreams we pursue and thus it should be made like a dreams, with endless pursuit of perfection.

# My Journey

I embarked on my journey into robotics during my first year at IIT Dhanbad. This was when I quickly gained proficiency in a wide range of tools, including [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/_downloads/2a9c64e08982f3709e23d20e5dc9f294/ros2-brochure-ltr-web.pdf), [Simulations](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9918-isaac-gym.pdf), Control and Hardware Interfacing, and [Kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics). Throughout this time, I built a strong foundation in the essential technologies that drive modern robotics.

In my second year, I was fortunate to be recognized by Professor [Shikha Singh](https://iitism.irins.org/profile/215120), under whom I had the opportunity to work for three months developing a prototype [UMV](https://bryanvas-cpu.github.io/posts/Unmanned-Vehicle/). This experience further deepened my knowledge and provided me with valuable insights into the field.

Since then, I have developed a strong interest in, [Vision based Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Learning_in_computer_vision),and [Deep Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reinforcement_learning)-based models, and I am currently applying these techniques in my work on a Hexapod project, where I continue to explore and refine my skills in this exciting area of robotics.
