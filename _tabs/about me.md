## Brief Introduction

Welcome! My name is [Aaromal](https://github.com/aaromal03), and I am a Mechanical Engineer, with primary interest in Automobiles. I am the Chief Designer of Mechismu Racing-Electric, Formula student team from India. I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. I'll be sharing my projects, insights and knowledge as I pursue my passion of developing vehicles, machines and robots.

My primary areas of expertise include:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Design, manufacture and optimize machines of all kinds.
- **Vehicle Development**: Drafting Dreams on wheels to move souls. From bending air to strengthening strucutres and everything in between. 
- **Design Solutions**: Developing products and machines for industrial problems.

I believe that vehicles and machines are more than some parts made to accomplish some task. They are the dreams we pursue and thus it should be made like a dreams, with endless pursuit of perfection.

# My Journey

From childhood, cars and bikes were always my thing, which existed in the bloodline, my DAD. He taught that cars are way more than a means of transport. The way he loved his rides, always made me dream of designing and making vehicles. This passion made Mechanical Engineering, the only branch I wanted after [JEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination). Even before joining college I started to develop my skills in CAD, which I exercise on a daily basis. 

After joining college, I participated in various design competitions and also won some of them. The big moment in the journey came after the sessions from [Mechismu](https://www.instagram.com/mechismuracing/). I started learning Vehicle Dynamics, which is the base for any kind of vehicle development. As my journey in Mechismu started, I started learning more about Formula Race-car development. I contributed in designing the MREX-01 and lead the mechanical division in development of MREX-02, the first electric racecar from our college, and the first car in 6 years, re-estabilihing the club's prestige.

I have designed, manufactured, tested and optimized multiple systems of the racecar like [Suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension), [Steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering), [Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_frame) and [Electro-mechanical](https://www.ultralibrarian.com/2023/11/16/electromechanical-components-in-electric-vehicles-ulc) systems. I continue to explore and refine my skills in these exciting areas of vehicles.
